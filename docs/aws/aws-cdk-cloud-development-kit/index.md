# AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit)

AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) is a stack that allows you to define the AWS resources you are using in your app as code. It is part of the managed-services of AWS allowing you to write your infrastructure as code.

It ships with methods that enable the app to connect with AWS CloudFormation Stacks. A demo of how the CDK works and its methods are in the app `packages/aws-cdk-demo-app`

More on AWS CloudFormation - see AWS parent folder and sub-folder AWS CloudFormation.

# Overview

CDK stacks are 1-2-1 equivalents of AWS CloudFormation Stacks.
