Tags are just customerâ€‘defined metadata, and you can use it for AWS services that support Tags - eg  cost allocation, resource grouping, for access control, etc.
 
The CDK provides this ability for us to add in tags to multiple resources. 

Tags are applied in the entry point directory - the bin directory
Or in the stack file where the tag is related to a specific stack
