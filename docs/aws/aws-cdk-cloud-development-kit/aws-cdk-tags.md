# AWS CDK Tags

Tags are just customerâ€‘defined metadata, and you can use it for AWS services that support Tags - eg cost allocation, resource grouping, for access control, etc.

The CDK provides this ability for us to add in tags to multiple resources.

Tags are applied in the entry point directory - the bin directory - OR in the stack file where the tag is related to a specific stack.
