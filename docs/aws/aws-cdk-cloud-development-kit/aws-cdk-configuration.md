# AWS CDK Configuration

All dependencies can be installed with npm from the aws core cdk services - lerna can be used as a package manager across all node-based repos

Some useful dependencies to install

s3 `npm install @aws-cdk/aws-s3 --save`
amplify `npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli`

Once installed AWS and all dependencies have to be configured

- `aws configure`
- `amplify configure`
