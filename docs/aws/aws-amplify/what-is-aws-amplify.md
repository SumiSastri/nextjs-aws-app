Amplify allows developers to quickly spin up a backend - whether using a REST or GraphQL API.

It is a platform that includes a plethora of tools and services that enable users to connect apps, deploy static web apps, manage and create applications for AWS Cloud.

It provides authentication, analytics, storage, caching, ui-components and API-creation/management.

With the Amplify CLI you get a connection between the Frameworks of the App/ Cloud Services of AWS and Developer tools. The CLI helps us to configure everything in the backend. More on [https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/]

You can also programatically create the Amplify environment which is the layer between the front-end applications and the backend data layer. It is not an API gateway but an environment in the network layer to provide connectivity specifically with AWS backend services.

The useful services are:
Amplify CLI - as well as its own management console (Amplify Console not the AWS Console).

Libraries - Using AWS Amplify, you can add, integrate and interact with AWS cloud services through this component. The library also facilitates safe authentication, storage of files, data stocking, serverless APIs, analytics, push notifications, AR/VR, and multiple other applicationsâ€™ features.

UI components - the authentication-requirement component for example is a pre-built sign-in form that you can integrate into any front-end library like Next/ React.
