A javascript library for developers to quickly configure, manage and create applications for AWS Cloud

It provides authentication, analytics, storage, caching, ui-components and API-creation/management. With the Amplify CLI you get a connection between the Frameworks of the App/ Cloud Services of AWS and Developer tools. The CLI helps us to configure everything in the backend.

You can also programatically create the amplify environment which is the layer between the front-end applications and the backend data layer. It is not an API gateway but an environment in the network layer to provide connectivity specifically with AWS back end services.

Amplify has its own command line interface (Amplify CLI)
Its own management console (Amplify Console)
Libraries that it is compatible with (Nextjs/ React as well as Angular)
