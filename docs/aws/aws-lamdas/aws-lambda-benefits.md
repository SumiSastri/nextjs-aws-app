# AWS Lambda Benefits

You only pay for the compute you use. You don't pay for compute time when your code is not running. This makes AWS Lambda ideal for variable and intermittent workloads.

You can run code for virtually any application or back‑end service, all with zero administration.

AWS Lambda runs your code on highly available compute infrastructure, which provides all administration, including server and operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning, and Auto Scaling, code monitoring, and logging.

AWS Lambda supports a variety of programming languages, including Node.js, Java, C#, and Python.

AWS Lambdas are used for event‑driven computing. You can run code in response to events, including changes to an S3 bucket or an Amazon DynamoDB table. You can respond to HTTP requests using Amazon API Gateway. You can invoke your code using API calls made using the AWS Software Development Kits (SDKs).

You could build serverless applications that are triggered by AWS Lambda functions, and you can automatically deploy them using AWS CodePipeline and AWS CodeDeploy. AWS Lambda is intended to support serverless and microservices applications.

It's really simple to build your Lambda function. You configure your Lambda environment, then you upload your code and watch it run.

- Refactor applications to fit the lamda requirements

- Limitiations of compute power

- Long running work flows - time outs on lamdas can be a negative

- Runtime environment different from code written - devs needed for both
