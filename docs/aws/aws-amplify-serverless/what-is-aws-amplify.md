Amplify is a development framework that helps you make full stack apps. Launched in 2017. The aim was to unify web-mobile apps with backend systems.

It connects frontend libraries/ stacks to AWS backend Cloud Services.

At the design layer ot has a UI Component Library
At the network layer you can use either REST or GraphQL queries for your HTTP calls for API-creation/management.
At the data services layer it provides authentication, analytics, storage & caching
At the infrastructure & orchestration layer you can deploy and manage your full stack apps programmatically with the Amplify command-line-tool (CLI)

The Amplify CLI you get a connection between the frontend frameworks of the App and the backend Cloud Services of AWS with a host of developer tools.

Eg: - `amplify add name of service` - adds the name of an AWS service you want to configure to your project.

You can also programatically create the Amplify environment which is the layer between the front-end applications and the backend data layer.

Amplify isn't an API gateway but an environment in the network layer to provide connectivity specifically with AWS backend services with frontend libraries and frameworks.
