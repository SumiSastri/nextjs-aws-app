# Amplify Services

1. Amplify CLI - as well as its own management console (Amplify Console not the AWS Console). There are 175 backend services that can be accessed programatically with the CLI. As seen in the above example by running a short command - `amplify add name of service` you can add any of these servies

Amplify CLI docs[https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/]

2. Amplify Libraries - in addition to access to the 175 plus resources in the AWS Cloud with the AWS CLI, Amplify also has specific libraries to facilitate safe authentication, storage of files, data stocking, serverless APIs, analytics, push notifications, AR/VR, and multiple other applicationsâ€™ features

3. Amplify UI components - the authentication-requirement component for example is a pre-built sign-in form that you can integrate into any front-end library like Next/ React.

4. Amplify Studio - a workflow tool
