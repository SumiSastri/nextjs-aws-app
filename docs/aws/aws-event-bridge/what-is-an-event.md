# What Is An Event

An event is a record of an action in the past that will update and change depending on the input to change the underlying data (state) of the record. With the AWS EventBridge, this event is represented by a JSON object.
Contains data about the event and data from the event.

For example if a button is clicked, the data about that click event is stored in a JSON object.
