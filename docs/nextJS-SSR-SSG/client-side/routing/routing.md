With NextJS as it is a framework, no routing libraries are required. Page based routing delivers a route based on the page file names.

Therefore all the folders in the pages folder are responsible for the front-end routing of the app.

When a page is created in the pages directory it is automatically available as a route as it is compiled server side and served up as an HTML page.
