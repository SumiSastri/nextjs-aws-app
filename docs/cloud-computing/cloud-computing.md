 AWS Definition - Cloud computing is the on‑demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources through a cloud services platform via the internet with pay‑as‑you‑go pricing

Cloud computing means you can have data infrastructure stored on 3rd party services where you rent their servers and host your data 'in the cloud' - or in simple terms you use the internet to access the server space.

The fee you pay is a on-usage operational cost rather than a up front infrastructure cost. The fee can be managed as you scale and you do not pay for unused on-prem server space. It increases speed and agility as you scale up as you can rent space on multiple servers outside your city/ region/ country and continent depending on the cloud services you choose.

The downside is that someone else is in control of your data. You are reliant on the 3rd party for data security, privacy, latency. You are also reliant on their failovers (if a data-centre in the cloud fails).

Therefore choosing a cloud hosting partner can be tricky and shifting from one cloud computing partner to another costly. 

Debugging - You still need to hire people who are conversant with the cloud computing services to maintain and manage the server space you are hiring or use a third party tool to debug the code used by the cloud service partner.

Cutting edge quirks - new technologies may not fit your use cases.

Security and compliance can not be outsourced - you still have to have a security policy for your customers data that you collect and store whether on premise or on the cloud.

Figuring out costs - all cloud service providers charge for their services on a tiered basis and you need to understand what capacity you may need and what you need buy - IaaS/ PaaS or SaaS.
