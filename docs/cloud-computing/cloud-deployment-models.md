 Public cloud - what is abbreviated to "the cloud". 
 
  Private cloud - on a private premise abbreviated to "on‑prem". This is when you have a cloud‑like platform in a private data center. 
  
  Hybrid, meaning you have an organization that is leveraging both a public cloud, but those public cloud applications are working in tandem with a private cloud within their own data centers. 
  
  And so it's important to understand that for some, especially large organizations, they could be using both a public, private, or using them together in a hybrid model.
