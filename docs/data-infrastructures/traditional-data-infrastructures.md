- On premise servers
- Locally hosted data
- External hard drives

Scaling is a challenge

- What happens when you want to expand services out of your city/ region/ country/ contient
- More on-premise servers are required to make sure latency (delivery of data to local machines) is not a problem
- Security, compliance and maintenance is expensive - large up-front capital expense
