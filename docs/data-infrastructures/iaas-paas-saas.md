IaaS-PaaS-SaaS can be seen as a spectrum. And on this spectrum on one end, we have absolute control. But on the other end, we have minimum maintenance and a degree of automation. 

IaaS -  This is where we run servers in the cloud, virtual servers, that are very similar to how we would run servers in our own data center, meaning that we have full access to those servers. We can change the OS that's running on them. We can completely configure them to do exactly what we want. However, we also have to perform maintenance on those servers, keep them up and running to do exactly what we want them to do.

PaaS - wordpress -  you are given a service that is configured but you can also customise it. Elastic Beanstalk is the AWS equivalent

SaaS - Email service providers/ chatbots fall into this category. You don't have to worry about configuring servers. It is just provided to you as a service.
